Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Force extra installation to the EFI removable media path?
 Some EFI-based systems are buggy and do not handle new bootloaders correctly.
 If you force an extra installation of GRUB to the EFI removable media path,
 this should ensure that this system will boot Debian correctly despite such a
 problem. However, it may remove the ability to boot any other operating
 systems that also depend on this path. If so, you will need to make sure that
 GRUB is configured successfully to be able to boot any other OS installations
 correctly.

Template: grub2/device_map_regenerated
Type: note
_Description: /boot/grub/device.map has been regenerated
 The file /boot/grub/device.map has been rewritten to use stable device
 names. In most cases, this should significantly reduce the need to change
 it in future, and boot menu entries generated by GRUB should not be
 affected.
 .
 However, since more than one disk is present in the system, it is possible
 that the system is depending on the old device map. Please check whether
 there are any custom boot menu entries that rely on GRUB's (hdN) drive
 numbering, and update them if necessary.
 .
 If you do not understand this message, or if there are no custom
 boot menu entries, you can ignore this message.
